    <h1>CODING CHALLENGE 3</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p>
        John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
        <br> tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
        <br><br>
        <br>In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
        <br>1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
        <br>2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip)

(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
    </p>
