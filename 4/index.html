    <h1>CODING CHALLENGE 4</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p>
        Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and methods.
        <br><br>1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height
        <br>2. Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.
        <br>3. In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.
    </p>
    <h2>Answer</h2>
    <p>Open developer tools and click on console to see the execution of java-script</p>
