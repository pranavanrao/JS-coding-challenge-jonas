    <h1>Coding Challenge 5</h1>
    <h2>Question :</h2>
    <p>
        This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
        <br>John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

        <br>Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:
        <br>1. Create an object with an array for the bill values
        <br>2. Add a method to calculate the tip
        <br>3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations
        <br>4. As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and 2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip). HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.


        <br>EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45.
        <br>Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).

        <br>5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules
        <br>6. Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips. HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average)
        <br>7. Calculate the average tip for each family
        <br>8. Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average
    </p>
